# GPT-Cody
GPT-Cody is an artificial intelligence system that helps you automate coding. You only need to provide the idea.

GPT-Cody uses a step-by-step approach to generate logic for your project. It then feeds the logic to a fine-tuned coding GPT model, Codex GPT-4, which writes pseudo code and selects the best stack for your project. Next, it writes the actual code and optimizes it by communicating with a general GPT model and using self-reflection techniques. Finally, it writes tests for the code and submits the codebase to an AIS reviser.
